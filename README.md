# 6WeekAverage
Final Project

 I work for Publix in the meat department. Seafood is part of the meat department, there are trays that the seafood employees have to make with shrimp each day, and there is an argument between the opener and the closer about how many should have been made each and every day. The meat department has an automatic list that shows a running six-week average on each item, so we do not over produce, but seafood has no such tools. So, I created one. I made a simple program that could be used to discover a rolling six-week average for an item in the department. First, I created a list [] and restricted it to six numbers. Next part of the code made it so whenever a 7th number is added the program replaced the oldest number or the 0 place. The final bit of code asks of input and returns an error if it is not able to convert into a float. Then the program returns the average for whatever numbers have been added so far.

I did not have much trouble during this assignment however, what little errors I did have were quickly solved by running it through AI, mostly just spelling issues and missing a :.
